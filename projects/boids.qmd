<!-- ## **Parallel Boids** -->

::::::{.grid}
:::{.g-col-10 .g-start-2}

This is a project I undertook in COMP445 Parallel and Distributed Computer with Professor Libby Shoop. @fig-boids shows an example run of the final product, where 512 boids are being simulated on 4 threads, each boid colored with respect to thread.

#### Aims

::::::{.grid}
:::{.g-col-8 .g-start-3}

I enjoy parallel programming, yet it can be difficult to achieve the visual understanding and satisfaction of a given algorithm. Therefore, my aim was to implement [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) in parallel and visualize them. My greatest motivation was that I wished to visually observe the speedup of the simulation when rendering in parallel. 

I used variety of parallelization paradigms and implemented the algorithm in C/C++.

Professor Libby Shoop and I turned this project into a submission to EduPar2024 as a Peachy Parallel Assignment, intended to help educate future parallel programming students.
