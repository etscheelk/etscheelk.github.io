When trying to think of an excuse to work in C and the Linux environemnt, I came across the 
annoying quibble of how incessant it can be to navidate with `cd` and `ls` repeatedly when you 
don't know where anything is. 

So I had the idea of a visual directory explorer where the user can explore with arrows keys, enter or space, alongside a fuzzy-search (`fzf`) to filter items within the current directory.

#### Roadblocks

Use of this TUI library has provides some challenges. 
Though a documentation page exists, it is insufficient for my tastes. 
It seems to provide brief comments helpful mostly to a person already familiar with the library.
Example projects are the only way to begin to parse the unknown territory. 

Some other required documetation is also missing: It is left as a mystery as to which items are allocated on the heap. The "object" types this library provides largely have an `..._unref()` command, yet it requires trial and error to discern at all if they must be deallocated or not in various situations. 

I also believe the best documentation is code that documents itself.
