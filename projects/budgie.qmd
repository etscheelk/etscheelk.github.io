<!-- ## **Budgie's Adventure in Solitude** (a game) -->

*Budgie* is a platformer game I made the junior year of my highschool in Unity as part of a video game development course. 
This was the first programming project I ever worked on. I additionally did all the art and animation.

Air jumps cost health and all diamonds must be collected before the player can exit via the door. Why are they called Budgie, Robert, and Michael? I don't know. 

It was super valuable to gain this experience programming at this age because my high school did not have any other programming courses
