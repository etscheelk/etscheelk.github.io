<!-- ## **Dogger** -->

Dogger is a version of Frogger where you play as a dog who must retrieve tennis balls your owner has thrown too far. I made this as part of a group in a Java class sophomore year of college.

The dog's name is Chaucer Bandogrick III. He doesn't die, he just gets hurt. 

I created the animations for the dog, alongside the tileset. My groupmate Dan made the vehicles and he did a fantastic job.

This one was just a lot of fun to make. And it's another game with a name pun.
