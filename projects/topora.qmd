I have the pleasure of being a post-bachelors research assistant as part of an 8-week research cohort with Professor Lori Ziegelmeier at Macalester College.
As a cohort of four, we will contribute to Lori's Topological Data Analysis research.

Our research for this summer is regarding the connection between keywords in scientific papers. 
Topological data analysis can interpret the shape of data, so the aim of this project is to identify connections between research fields given their keywords and topics. 
Additionally, this can be used to identify regions of research that have not otherwise received attention--What if there's some overlap of fields ripe for original research?

This research program goes from 20 May to 12 July 2024. More details will follow.
