Topology is a field of mathematics concerned with the fundamental description of mathematic "objects", quantifying and comparing their shape and relationship. More physically, topology is about the relationship of objects, such as the number of holes and contained voids, and how one can continuously deform object $A$ to become object $B$ without any cutting or gluing. 

The most famous example of this problem is the torus (e.g. donut) and the coffee cup. Topologically, they are the same shape!
