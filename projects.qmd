abstract: "This is a list of projects and work that is important to me, but it does not define me entirely. You'll find programming projects like boids, a music game, a text adventure, and a Linux CLI; then you'll also find my other interests in Mathematics such as work I've done in Topological Data Analysis; further you'll find some miscellaneous work I'm proud of, such as my 6-page poem *Tattered Time*."
