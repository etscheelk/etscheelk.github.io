Figure¬†1 shows an example run of the final product, where 512 boids are being simulated on 4 threads, each boid colored with respect to thread.\nGitHub Repository \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Simulation of 512 boids on 4 threads.

Therefore, my aim was to implement Boids in parallel and visualize them. My greatest motivation was that I wished to visually observe the speedup of the simulation when rendering in parallel.\nI used variety of parallelization paradigms and implemented the algorithm in C/C++.\n\n\n\n\nTools\n\n\nI used parallel pragma directives via OpenMP and OpenACC in order to distribute the calculations for boid updates. OpenACC is available via NVIDIA‚Äôs High Performance Computing (HPC) SDK, installed to Ubuntu in WSL2, displayed on an X Window.\nThe HPC SDK provides a new, powerful compiler nvc/nvc++, which is backwards compatible with OpenMP pragma directives, but also pragma acc and pragma acc kernels directives. This compiler also functions with nvprof, NVIDIA‚Äôs profiler. Also provides a CUDA install.\nThe first edition of this boids simulation used psplot with an X window. Once it was shown it could be parallelized that way, I implemented it using a C++ library TSGL (GitHub ), the Thread-Safe Graphics Library, meant for parallel algorithm visualizations, made by an associate of Professor Libby.\n\n\n\n\nEduPar2024 Submission\n\n\nProfessor Libby (Elizabeth) Shoop (Macalester College) and I turned this project into a submission to EduPar2024 as a Peachy Parallel Assignment, intended to help educate future parallel programming students.\nThis assignment will be presented May 27 in San Francisco by Professor Libby. Program Schedule.\nThis involved cleaning up code, documenting it amply for both professors and students, and creating homework documents. It features a few different assignments for various levels. A psplot edition using OpenMP, or GPU parallel with OpenACC. Then a higher level version in C++ implemented with TSGL, intended for an upper level undergraduate course, such as the course I took.\nAssignment GitHub .",

    "text": "1.3 dirview üöß\n\n\nWhen trying to think of an excuse to work in C and the Linux environemnt, I came across the annoying quibble of how incessant it can be to navidate with cd and ls repeatedly when you don‚Äôt know where anything is.\nSo I had the idea of a visual directory explorer where the user can explore with arrows keys, enter or space, alongside a fuzzy-search (fzf) to filter items within the current directory.\nIt‚Äôs not my intention to make the World‚Äôs Next Best Linux Directory Explorer, but just a little fun project I‚Äôd be happy to spend some time and learning on.\nGitHub Repository \n\n\n\nCurrent Status\n\n\nThe typing bar is in workable state and that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs needed right now. Next up is to display items in the current directory. Will also figure out how to get fzf to show just the items in the current directory.\nMy experience in Godot has provided some background experience in using event/signal-based programming.\n\n\n\n\nRoadblocks\n\n\nUse of this TUI library has provided some challenges. Though a documentation page exists, it is insufficient for my tastes. It seems to provide brief comments helpful mostly to a person already familiar with the library. Example projects are the only way to begin to parse the unknown territory.\nSome other required documetation is also missing: It is left as a mystery as to which items are allocated on the heap. The ‚Äúobject‚Äù types this library provides largely have an ..._unref() command, yet it requires trial and error to surmise this important memory status.\nI also believe the best documentation is code that documents itself.\n\n\n\n\nLessons\n\n\nWorking with tickit has given me a lot of experience with working in unfamiliar territory. Additionally, I had not before used any libraries like this, providing primitive object and event behavior within C. Member functions are replicated with structs passed as pointers, side effects the goal with little safety save for the compiler type checker and runtime memory safety. Don‚Äôt worry C, you‚Äôre still cool. Makes me understand the significance of the choices made within the construction of object oriented programming languages, such as member functions providing API.",
