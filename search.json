More physically, topology is about the relationship of objects, such as the number of holes and contained voids, and how one can continuously deform object \\(A\\) to become object \\(B\\) without any cutting or gluing.\nThe most famous example of this problem is the torus (e.g.¬†donut) and the coffee cup.
