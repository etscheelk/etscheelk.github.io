In form it is unlike their literature, yet echoes some themes such as prophecy of oppression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Tattered Time, or That Starred Ensign\n\n\n\n\n\nTime (a sestina)\n\nThis a sestina, a peculiar poetical form from Italy, where line-ending words are repeated and permuted under a certain pattern.\nThis was not easy to write, but it is interested and I’d be curious to have another try so many years after this was written.\nI wrote this particular one as part of a creative writing course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Time, a sestina\n\n\n\n\n\nCreation Myth\n\nThis poem was created under the idea of a being that is immortal (yet not invincible) living forever and seeing everything the universe can offer, yet still of fallible, human memory.\nI wrote this and rewrote it under revision as part of the same creative writing course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Creation Myth"
