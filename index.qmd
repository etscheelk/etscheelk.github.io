## Ethan Scheelk

I'm Ethan Scheelk and I'm a 2024 graduate with Computer Science and Mathematics majors from Macalester College in Saint Paul. Immediately after graduation I'll be doing eight weeks of Mathematics research with Macalester professor Lori Ziegelmeier. 

My career and programming interests lie in or around systems programming---to be specific, programming with respect to the hardware it will be running on. So, I love using lower level languages like C and interacting with Linux.

Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary over a many quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, suddenly I heard a tapping, as if someone rapping at my chamber door.  -->
